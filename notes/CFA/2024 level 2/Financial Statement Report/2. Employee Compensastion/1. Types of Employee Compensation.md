#### 1. Short-term benefits

- The accounting for short-term benefits
  - When earned: compensation expense（会计科目）上升，current liability上升
    - expense上升，对于B/S: RE下降，L上升
  - When settlement: cash(CFO-) 下降，current liability下降
    - BS: cash ⬇️，L⬇️
  - For manufacuring-related employees, compensation costs are capitalized to inventories and later expensed as cost of sales when goods are sold.
    - 生产一线员工工资，capitalized as inventory。卖出的时候确认COGS.
    - 这里注意，不同人员的薪酬是否确认费用，费用类别不一样。比如管理人员，就是管理费用，研发人员，就是R&D。
