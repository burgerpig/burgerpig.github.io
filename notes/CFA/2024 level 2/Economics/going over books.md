# 1. Currency 

- The spot exchange rate is usually used for settlement on the second business day after the trade date, referred to as $T + 2$ settlement (the exception being CAD/USD, for which standard spot settlement is $T + 1$)

- The interbank market is typically for dealing sizes of at least 1 million units of the base currency. Of course, the dealing amount can be larger than 1 million units; indeed, interbank market trades generally are measured in terms of multiples of a million units of the base currency. Please note that many non-bank entities can now access the interbank market. They include institutional asset managers and hedge funds.
