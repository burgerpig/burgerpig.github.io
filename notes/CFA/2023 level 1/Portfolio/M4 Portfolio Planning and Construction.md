## Portfolio Planning

##### Major components of investment policy statement(IPS)

- Introduction
  - Describes the client
- Statemenf of purpose
- Statement of duties and responsibilities
- Procedures
  - Steps to update IPS and procedures to respond to contingencies
- **Investment objectives** (RRTTLLU)
  - Client's objectives in investing(return & risk)

- **Investment constraints**
  - The factors constrain the client in the investing
- Investment guidelines
  - Execution policy(e.g., use of leverage and derivatives) and assets that are allowed to invest
- Evaluation and review
  - Feedback on ivestment results
- Appendices 附录
  - Strategic asset allocation (SAA), rebalancing policy

##### Reasons for writing an IPS

- Identifies client objectives and constraints
- Clear statement of client risk tolerance and return requirements
- Imposes investment discipline on both client and manager
  - 基金经理以IPS为依据进行投资
- Serves as a guideline to assess the suitability of a particular investment.
- Identifies a benchmark portfolio consistent with client preferences.

##### Return objectives 

- Specify what return is required by the client
  - Absolute return objectives
    - 和固定的某个required return 比
  - Relative return objectives
    - 和大盘比，和通胀inflation比

**Risk Objectives**

- The **risk tolerance** of the client is specified.(风险目标取决于客户的风险承受能力)
  - Absolute risk objectives
    - 比如要求波动率不能超过某个值
  - Relative risk objectives
    - 和指数之间的差距的标准差不能太大（不能围绕指数波动太大）
    - tracking error, difference with CPI, difference with inflation
- Factors dependent upon:
  - Psychological factors
  - Personal factors: age, family situation, existing wealth, insurance coverage, cash reserves, income

- 客观因素**Ability to bear risk**: depends on inestment horizon, insurance, income, wealth, financial responsibilites(不仅看财富，也要看负债)
- 主观因素**Willingness to bear risk**: depens on attitudes and beliefs about investment risk.
  - if **willingness > ability**: advisor should go with ability
  - if **ability > willingness**: educate the investor about investment risk, but do not attempt to change personality/psychological characteristics.

##### Investment constraints (TTLLU)

- **Liquidity**: the potential need for cash
- **Legal and regulatory:** applies more to institutional investors, but also affects individual investors(e.g., IRA accounts).
- **Time horizon**: the time unitl the proceeds of the investment will be requried.
  - 投资时间长度，一般long-term，对于个人来说一般考虑multi-stage，多个阶段的需求。

- **Tax concerns:** is the account taxable, tax-deferred, or tax-exempt
  - 考虑税收优惠
- **Unique needs and preferences**: anything that does not fit into the above catogories.
  - 特殊投资癖好

- SAA是长期资产配置
- Specifications of asset classes 资产分类
  - Correlations of returns of assets **within** an asset class should be relatively **high**
  - Correlations of returns **between** asset classes should be **low**

##### Steps of portfolio construction

- Use risk, return, and correlations among asset classes to construct an efficient frontier. 构建有效风险前沿（投资产品的supply）
- **Strategic asset alocation**: use objectives and constraints from IPS to select an optimal portfolio
- **Tactical asset allocation**(deviations from SAA), and security selection as permitted and approprate.
  - TAA和SAA的偏离是短期short-term，并且是小幅度的偏离。
- Security selection and rebalancing
- Risk budgeting风险预算: allocates permitted risk to strategic allcoation, tactical allcoation, and security selection.
  - 对有限可以承受的风险进行分配

##### ESG considerations

- **Environmental issues**
  - Carbon emissions, air pollution, biodiversity, etc.
- **Social issues**
  - Labor standards, human rights, community relations, etc.
- **Governance issues**
  - Board compositon, bribery and corruption, executive compensation, etc.
  - 这里是公司治理情况

##### ESG consideration implementation approaches

- Negative screening(exclusionary screening)
  - 逆向筛选，把不满足ESG的排除portfolio
- Best-in-class
  - Best-in-class vs. shareholder engagement

- Thematic investing
  - 主题投资
- ESG integration
