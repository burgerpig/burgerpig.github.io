### Pool Investment

**Describe** mutual funds and **compare** them with other pooled investment products

#### Pool Investment

- **Mutual funds**
  - Open-end funds
  - Closed-end funds
- **Exchanged traded funds(ETF)**
- Separately managed accounts(SMA)
  - 专门请一个基金经理管理，单独管理。可以认为是直接持有基金所投资的股票
  - 基金信息对投资者更加透明
  - 根据投资者定制化
  - 需要较高资金量，门槛高
  - **无限责任**，比如杠杆交易造成亏损需要投资者偿还
- Hedged funds
  - 追求绝对收益
  - 通常使用较高杠杆
- Buyout funds 收购基金
  - 属于PE（Private Equity）
  - LBO（复习：另类投资中的leverage buyout）
- Venture capital funds
  - 属于PE（Private Equity）

##### Mutual Fund: Open-end Mutual fund

- Investors can buy and redeem the mutual fund shares at **net asset value(NAV)** 净值
  - Number of shares issued would increase as new investments are made, or decrease when withdrawn occur. 申购赎回不会影响原有per share NAV
  - Not fully invested as some cash kept for redemption
    - 需要留有部分现金应对赎回
  - Fee charged: management fees, upfront fees（前端费用，申购费）, redemption fees.

##### Mutual Fund: Closed-end mutual fund

- No new investments are accepted
  - Number of shares issued does not change
  - Investors can only liquidate the shares by selling them to other investors.
    - 在二级市场卖出
  - Traded at a **premium or discount to net asset value. **\*\*\*
    - 受到供给关系影响，可能溢价或者折价。
  - Could be fully invested.
    - 不用留有现金应对赎回。
  - Fee charged: management fees, upfront fees.

##### Classification of mutual funds

- By fees
  - No-load funds 申购赎回时不收费的基金
  - load funds 申购赎回时收费的基金
- By asset types
  - Money market funds
  - Bond funds
  - Stock funds
  - Hybrid/balanced funds

##### Exchanged-Traded Fund(ETF) \*\*

一级市场中：用股票（in kind实物）换份额，一级市场参与者都是大型机构（AP授权参与者）

二级市场中：机构拆分ETF份额，转卖给个人投资者。

- Traded like closed-end fund
- Price **tracking** net asset value
  - tracking意思是，在套利空间小于交易成本的范围内波动。
  - 复习：closed-end mutual fund也会偏离NAV，但是open-end 不会偏离
- Transaction costs are **lower** compared to mutual funds
- Dividends are paid out to shareholders
  - 传统mutual fund一般用来再投资
- Minimum required investment is smaller than that of index funds
- Tax advantages over index funds
  - 普通的基金赎回时会发生现金流。一个投资者赎回，基金经理需要卖股票，产生资本利得（capital gain）需要交税。这里交的税是基金去交，所以所有投资者收到影响。
  - 但是ETF是实物赎回，赎回时不会发生现金流，赎回的是现货。所以不涉及到税。
  - 也就是ETF不会有capital gain distribution.
