##### Guidance

- **Buy-side clients** may influence **sell-side** analyst's independence because:
  - Portfolio managers have significant positions in the security under review
  - a downgrade may affect the manager's compensation
  - bad performance may affect the manager's professional reputation.
  - buy-side clients就是基金经理
- **Influence during manager(or custodians) selection process** 挑选基金经理
  - In a hiring capacity, **should not solicit** gifts, contributions, or other compensation; and **refuse** gifts, donations, and other offered compensation that may be perceived to influence decision-making process.
  - When working to earn a new investment allocation, members and candidates **should not offer** gifts, contributions, or other compensation to influence the decision of the hiring representative. (e.g., **pay-to-play**，政治献金)

  - Performance analysts业绩分析师 must not allow internal or external influence to affect their independence and objectivity.

- **Investment banking relationships** 投行和分析师之间的冲突 \*\*\*

  - **"Firewalls**" are used to minimize conflicts of interest.(e.g., separate reporting structures, compensation arrangements)
    - 隔离墙：物理隔离（办公场所）、管理隔离（上级领导不是同一人）、信息隔离（不可以直接互通信息，需要经过合规等）

- **Public companies** 上市公司和分析师
  - Analysts must not be pressured to issu favorable reports by the companies they follow.

下面是具体避免冲突的方法

    - 公司雇佣分析师撰写报告的时候，需要事先确定的固定费用，分析师要披露冲突。

- **Travel funding** 差旅费 \*\*\*
  - Best practice is to pay by themselves or pay by their firms
  - May accept modestly arranged travel when commercial transportation is unavailable(e.g., the destination is **remote**), but disclosure is needed.
    - 调研地点是remote\far away\not easily accessible的时候可以例外，但是需要披露

- **Gifts\*\*\***
  
  - **Modest gifts**(token gift 小礼物) are acceptable, but special care must be taken to resist pressures to act in conflict with the interests of their clients.
  
  - **Best practice** is to **reject** any offer of gift or entertainment that could be expected to threaten their independence and objectivity.
  
  - A gift from a client is acceptable but should be disclosed to their employers prior to accepting such gift or benefit. 
  
  - 礼物分为两种：
    - 研究对象送的礼物：
      - modest/token可以收
      - 大礼物、贵重的礼物不可以
      - 客户报答：可以收，但是需要**事先**获得雇主批准
  
##### Recommendation

- Create a **restricted list**(限制清单) **\*\*\***
  - 券商列出限制清单，分析师不再对限制清单里的公司发表买入卖出意见，避免和投行等部门形成利益冲突。
- Restrict special cost arrangements 规范差旅费等支出
  - For example, members should encourage issuers to limit use of corporate aircraft to situations in which commercial transportation is not available.

- Limit gifts 收礼限制
  - The standard does not preclude customary and ordinary business-related entertainment as long as its purpose is not to influence members and candidates.
- Restrict investments
  - Strict limits should be imposed on personnel investment on IPOs or private placement.

  - Outcomes from models shall not be presented as fact.
    - 估值的时候，不可以用按照事实去表述，应该是分析师个人的**opinion**.

##### Content

  - 不可以欺诈

##### Guidance

- The standards are **primarily** aimed at conduct related to a member's or candidate's **professional life.** 主要关注职业行为，不是个人行为。
  - Conduct that, although not illegal, but negatively affects a member's or candidate's trustworthiness or competence, is a violation.
    - 即使不违法，但是损害了可信度或者能力，也算违规
  - The lack of diligence(sufficient effort) in providing professional services may be a violation.
    - 不尽职不尽责
  - Do not seek the standards as a method of settling personal, political, or other disputes unrelated to professional ethics.
    - 不考虑个人生活，政治立场等和职业行为无关的行为.

  - Personal bankruptcy may violate the standard if it involves **fraudulent or deceitful business conduct.**
    - 因为欺诈导致的个人破产也算渎职

- 所以: 对于个人职业行为来说, 不尽职尽责算渎职;对于欺诈行为都算违规.

##### Content

- Members and Candidates who posses material nonpublic information that could affect the value of an investment **must not act or cause others to act** on the information.
  - 不能根据内幕信息行事或促使他人行事

##### Guidance

- **What is "material information"?** 重大信息的定义
  - The information is "material" if:
    - 1. its disclosure would have an **impact on the price** of a security
      2. investors would **want to know the information** before making an investment decision.
      3. the source of information is **reliable**(\*\*\*反义词：rumor，谣言不算重大信息)
    - Examples: earnings, merger & acquisition, innovative products(比如创新药20年保护期), changes in management, legal disputes, etc.

- **What consitutes "nonpublic" information?**
  - Information is "nonpublic" until it has been disseminated(传播) to the **marketplace in general**.
  - Information that is made available to **a select group of people** remains nonpublic.
    - 只向一小部分人公开的也是非公开信息
  - Members and candidates may use insider information legitimately for the specific purpose of conducting due diligence for such activities as mergers, security underwriting, credit ratings, etc.

- **Mosaic theory马赛克理论** \*\*\*
  - Members candidates do not violate the standard when they reach a material conclusion about a corporate action or event through an analysis of **public information** and **nonmaterial nonpublic information**.
    - 用非重大、非公开信息结合公开信息推出来的结论去做交易决策，不算违规

- **Social media**
  - Information from internet and social media platforms **may not** be considered public. Example: social media that requires membership in order to access the published content.
  - Members and candidates should **verify** that material information obtained from these sources can also be accessed from a source that is available to the public(e.g., webpages, press releases).
  - 由于平台会员等机制，社交媒体上看到的信息不一定是公开信息，需要搜索信息验证其是否为公开信息。

- **Using industry experts** 和专家交流
  - Members and candidates may speak with experts regarding economic conditions, industry trends, and technical issues relating to products and services.
  - Members and candidates are **prohibited** from taking investment actions based on material nonpublic information provided by industry experts.
  - 不能使用和行业专家沟通获得的重大非公开信息
- **Investment research reports**
  - When a particularly **well-known analyst** issues a report or makes changes to his or her recommendation, that information alone may have an effect on the market and thus may be considered material. Therefore, such a report would have to be **made public** at the time it was distributed to clients.
  - 知名分析师改变投资建议时，认为是重大信息，所以需要及时公布，公开化此消息。

##### Recommendation

- **Achieve public dissemination**
  - Members and candidates should make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination of material information. 尽力促使该信息公开化。
  - If public dissemination is not available, members and candidates must communicate the information only to their supervisory and compliance personnel of their firm. 
    - 无法公开化该信息的时候，应该通知上级或者合规部门。

### Standard III: Duties to Clients 对客户的忠诚

- III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care
  -  III（A）是纲领性的细则，只要违反下面四条细则，就一定违反III(A)
- III(B) Fair Dealing
- III(C) Suitability
- III(D) Performance Presentation
- III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality

#### III(A) Loyalty, Prudence and Care忠诚、审慎和谨慎

##### Content

- Members and Candidates have a duty of loyalty to their clients and must act with reasonable care and exercise prudent judegement.
- Members and Candidates must act for the benefits of their clients and place their client's interests **before** their employer's or their own interests.
  - 客户利益至上>雇主>自己的利益

##### Guidance

- **Understanding the application**
  - A minimum benchmark for the duties of loyalty, prudence, and care that are required of all members and candidates **regardless of** whether a **legal fiduciary** duty applies.（法定受托责任）
    - 不仅限于法定受托责任。
  - **Fiduciary duties** are often imposed by law or regulation when an individual or institution is charged with the duty of acting for the benefit of another party.
- **Identifying the actual investment client**
  - Special cases:
    - When the manager is responsible for the portfolios of **pension plans or trusts**, however, the client is not the person or entity who hires the manager but rather the **beneficiaries** of the plan or trust.
      - 基金经理管理养老金或者信托时，考虑的客户是养老金计划和信托的受益人。
    - If an actual client or group of beneficiaries does not exist, investment should be consistent with the **stated mandate**（基金说明文件）.没有具体的受益人的时候，按照说明文件行事。

- **Developing the client's portfolio**
  - Members and candidates should ensure:
    - investment recommendations and transactions are suitable to clients' objectives and circumstances. (和后面的III(C) suitability关联)
    - particular care must be taken on the potential conflict(潜在利益冲突) between the members and candidates or their firms and clients' interests.
      - 存在潜在利益冲突时，需要向客户披露
    - investment decisions are judged in the context of the **total portfolio**, rather than by individual investment.
      - 需要在整个投资组合的角度构建客户的portfolio.比如，风险中下的portfolio也可以小部分配置高风险的股票。
- **Soft dollar/commision(软美元) Policies 证券互惠行为**
  - **Soft dollar** is the practice that an investment manager uses client brokerage to purchase research services.
    - 比如，客户委托基金经理投资，基金经理选择broker进行交易。作为补偿，broker为基金经理提供免费的研究报告。
  - Brokerage is client's asset, its uses must benefit client.
    - broker提供的soft dollar是客户的资产，不能用去其他用途
  - "**Directed brokerage**" （客户制定经纪费）is a practice that a client directs a manager to use the client's brokerage to purchase services or goods for the client.
    - 客户可以选择broker.
  - **When selecting broker for clients, members must seek "best transaction cost" and "best execution".** \*\*\*
    - 首先考虑的不是证券互惠，而是佣金、交易速度。需要选择**性价比**最高的。比如，如果只按照佣金最低进行选择，或者只按照提供的soft dollar最高进行选择，都违反规定。

- **Proxy voting(代理投票) policies**
  - A cost-benefits analysis must be made prior to any proxy voting.
    - 是否参与投票需要根据cost-benefits analysis，看看参与投票是否影响客户的利益。
  - Voting proxies may not be necessary in all instances.
    - 不是强制要求投票。

##### Recommendation

- Regular acount information(**at least quarterly**) **每个季度**关注客户信息
- Client approval
- Firm policy
  - Follow all applicable rules and laws
  - Establish the investment objectives of the client
  - Consider all the infomration when taking actions
  - diversify
  - carry out regular revies
  - vote proxies and so on

![image-20230705112623325](./assets/image-20230705112623325.png)

- 养老金、信托：受益人是客户
- 选择broker是看性价比，既不是越便宜越好，也不是交易速度越快越好。
- 代理投票不一定，看cost-benefits analysis

#### III(B) Fair Dealing 公平对待

##### Content

- Members and Candidates **must deal fairly and objectively** with all clients when providing investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment action, or engaging in other professional activities.

##### Guidance

- **"Fair" is not "Equal"**
  - The standard does not state "equally" because:
    - communicating with all clients on a uniform basis presents practical problems due to differences in timing and methods of communications with clients
    - each client has unique needs and objectives
    - **firms may differentiate their services to clients, but different levels of services should be disclosed, and must not disadvantage any client.** 允许为客户提供差异化服务。（normal、VIP）但是提供的差异化服务需要对客户披露。不可以损害任何客户利益\*\*\*
- **Investment recommendations**
  - No discrimination against any client when disseminating investment recommendations.
    - 分发投资建议时不可以歧视，比如先告诉VIP，两小时后再告诉normal
  - Particular care should be taken that updated recommendation reaches those clients who have acted on the earlier advice.
    - 之前投资建议影响到的客户需要及时更新投资建议。
  - Clients who place orders **contrary** to a current recommendation should be <u>advised</u> before the order is accepted.
    - 客户进行相反操作时，需要先advise。

- **Investment action**
  - If security issue is **oversubscribed** (超额认购)， the issue should be **prorated** (按比例) to all subscribers.\*\*\*，超额认购，实际认购数量低于申购数量，按认购比例分配给每个客户。
  - Members and candidates should be prohibited from participating in "**hot issue**".
    - 热门股票，比如IPO发行的新股。也就是说，基金经理不可以自己参与打新，损害客户利益。
  - Family-member accounts are treated similarly to the accounts of other clients.\*\*
    - 基金经理的家庭成员的账户也应该公平对待（fee paying account）

<img src="./assets/image-20230705115557940.png" alt="image-20230705115557940" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### III(C) Suitability 适当性

##### Content

- When members and candidates are in **an advisory relationship**(咨询服务) with a client, they must:
  - make a reasonable inquiry into a client's or prospective client's investment experience, risk and return objectives, and financial constraints **prior** to making any investment recommendation or taking investment action and must **reassess and update** this information regularly.
    - 在做出投资建议或者投资行为前，了解客户的投资经验，风险和回报目标。并且定期更新，定期重新评估。

  - 共同基金mutual fund按照募集说明书，约定好的投资风格去投资即可。

##### Guidance

- **Developing and updating investment policy statement(IPS)**
  - The **IPS(投资政策声明)** addresses the client's risk tolerance, return requirement, investment constraints, the roles and repsonsiblities of the parties to the advisory relationship.
    - Risk tolerance, return requirement, investment contraints(RRLLTTU复习portfolioM4)
    - 需要深入了解客户，然后再提供建议
  - Based on the IPS, members and candidates can develop an appropriate strategic asset allocation.根据IPS配置股票
  - Updating the IPS should be repeated at least **annually and also prior to material changes**.每年以及重大变化之前更新。
- **Understanding the client's risk profile**
  - Consider whether **leverage** is suitable for clients. 不要随意给客户加杠杆。
- **Need for diversification**
  - The unique characteristics (or risks) of an individual investment may become partially or entirely neutralized when it is combined with other individual investments within a portfolio.
  - An investment with high relative risk may be a suitable investment in the context of the entire portfolio.

- **Addressing unsolicited(主动提出） trading requests**
  - When a client makes an **unsuitable** trade request:(和IPS不符合的request)
  
    - If it has only a **minimum impact** on the entire portfolio, first educating clients on the effects of the request, then may exectue the trade.
    - If it has a **material impact** on the portfolio, updating client's IPS may be necessary. If clients decline to modify their IPS while insisting the trade be made, determining whether continuing the relationship with the client.
  
    - 影响小：先教育再投资；影响大：改IPS，考虑是否结束关系。
  
- **Managing to an index or mandate** （管理的是mutual fund，跟踪大盘index或者自己的投资策略mandate）
  - Investing in a manner consistent with the mandate.
    - mutual fund只需要按照约定好的投资风格即可，不需要了解每一个投资者的情况。
  - Members and candidates are not responsible for determining the suitability of the fund for investors.
  - Determining suitability for clients applies to situations where members and candidates have an advisory relationship with clients. 存在咨询关系才需要考虑suitability.

##### Recommendation

- Investment policy statement 撰写IPS的建议
  - Client identification
    - Type of client, the existence of separete beneficiaries
      - 客户类型（机构、个人），有没有受益人
  - Investor objectives
    - Return objectives, risk tolerance

  - "Adequate" means meeting industry standards, regulatory requirements, the requirements of the Code and Standards, the circumstances of the firm.
  - Bring inadequate compliance system to the attention of senior management and recommend corrective action. 如果管理层发现合规系统不够充足（inadequate），需要上报并且提出改进意见。

    - simply reporting the misconduct up the chain of command. 只向上汇报。

    - simply warning the employee to cease the activity. 

- **Supervision includes detection**

  - If the supervisor makes a reasonable effort to detect violations, but fails to detect a violation that occurs, she is in compliance with the standard.
  - If no effort is made to dtect and prevent violations, the supervisor is in violation of the standard even if no violations by her subordinates have occurred.

  - supervision注重过程，不重结果：
    - 就算下属有人违规，但是supervisor尽力了，那么supervisor没有违规
    - 即使下属没有人违规，但是supervisor没有履行监督义务，那么supervisor也有违规。
