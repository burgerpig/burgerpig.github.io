#### M2 Financial Reporting Standard

Financial reporting standards provide principles for preparing financial reports and determine the types and amounts of information that must be provided to users of financial statements, including investors and creditors, so that they may make informed decisions.



the objective of financial reporting is to provide financial information that is useful to users in making decisions about pro- viding resources to the reporting entity, where those decisions relate to equity and debt instruments, or loans or other forms of credit, and in influencing management’s actions that affect the use of the entity’s economic resources.

Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reports

Fundamental two critical characteristics

**Relevance**:Information is relevant if it would potentially affect or make a difference in users’ decisions.

***Faithful representation***: Information that faithfully represents an economic phenomenon that it purports to represent is ideally complete, neutral, and free from error. 

Four enhancing characteristics:

***Comparability***: Comparability allows users “to identify and understand similarities and differences of items.” 

***Verifiability***: Verifiability means that different knowledgeable and inde- pendent observers would agree that the information presented faithfully represents the economic phenomena it purports to represent.

***Timelines*s**: Timely information is available to decision makers prior to their making a decision.

***Understandability***: Clear and concise presentation of information enhances understandability. 

**6 Elements of Financial Statements**

- Three elements related to measurement of financial position:

**Assets**:  present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result
 of past events.An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits. Assets are what a company owns (e.g., inventory and equipment).

**Liabilities**: present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events. An obligation is a duty or responsibility that the entity has no practical ability to avoid. Liabilities are what a com- pany owes (e.g., bank borrowings).

**Equity**: Assets less liabilities. Equity is the residual interest in the assets after subtracting the liabilities.

- Elements related to measurement of performance(profit)

**Expense**:Decreases in assets, or increases in liabilities, that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to holders of equity claims. 

**Income**:Increases in assets, or decreases in liabilities, that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from holders of equity claims.

- Underlying Assumptions in Financial Statements

**accrual accounting**: financial statements should reflect transactions in the period when they actually occur, not necessarily when cash move- ments occur. 

**going concern**:the company will continue in business for the foreseeable future

- Recognition means that an item is included in the balance sheet or income state- ment.

- Measurement of Financial Statement Elements

Measurement is the process of determining the monetary amounts at which the elements of the financial statements are to be recognized and carried in the balance sheet and income statement.

**Historical cost**: Historical cost is simply the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid to purchase an asset, including any costs of acquisition and/or preparation. 

**Amortised cost**: Historical cost adjusted for amortisation, depreciation, or depletion and/or impairment.

**Current cost**: In reference to assets, current cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents that would have to be paid to buy the same or an equiv- alent asset today. In reference to liabilities, the current cost basis of measurement means the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation today.

**Realizable (settlement) value**: In reference to assets, realizable value is the amount of cash or cash equivalents that could currently be obtained by selling the asset in an orderly disposal. For liabilities, the equivalent to realizable value is called “settlement value”—that is, settlement value is the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents expected to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business.

**Present value (PV)**: For assets, present value is the present discounted value of the future net cash inflows that the asset is expected to generate in the normal course of business. For liabilities, present value is the present discounted value of the future net cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course of business.

**Fair value**: is defined as an exit price, the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This may involve either market measures or present value measures depending on the availability of information.
