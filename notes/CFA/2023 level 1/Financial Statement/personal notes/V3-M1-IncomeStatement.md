**Revenue** generally refers to the amount charged for the delivery of goods or services in the *ordinary activities* of a business. 

**Net revenue** is sometimes used to specifically indicate that the revenue has been adjusted (e.g., for estimated returns).

excise taxes 消费税

e.g. net sales = sales - excise taxes



**Expenses** reflect outflows, depletions of assets, and incurrences of liabilities in the course of the activities of a business. 

At the bottom of the income statement, companies report net income (companies may use other terms such as “net earnings” or “profit or loss”.

Net income also includes **gains** and **losses**, which are increases and decreases in economic benefits, respectively, which may or may not arise in the ordinary activities of the business. 

- **net income** (profit or loss) can be defined as: 

​	a) income minus expenses, or equivalently 

​	b) revenue plus other income plus gains minus expenses, or equivalently 

​	c) revenue plus other income plus gains minus expenses in the ordinary activities of the business minus other expenses, and minus losses. 

The last definition can be rearranged as follows: 

net income equals 

​	(i) revenue minus expenses in the ordinary activities of the business, plus 

​	(ii) other income minus other expenses, plus 

​	(iii) gains minus losses.

- Subtotals

Certain items, such as revenue, finance costs, and tax expense, are required to be presented separately on the face of the income statement.

**i)** Expenses may be grouped together either by their **nature** or **function**. 

Grouping together expenses such as depreciation on manufacturing equipment and depreciation on administrative facilities into a single line item called “depreciation” is an example of a **grouping by nature** of the expense.

An example of **grouping by function** would be grouping together expenses into a category such as cost of goods sold, which may include labour and material costs, depreciation, some salaries (e.g., salespeople’s), and other direct sales related expenses.

**ii)** One subtotal often shown in an income statement is **gross profit** or **gross margin** (that is revenue less cost of sales).

When an income statement shows a gross profit subtotal, it is said to use a **multi-step format** rather than a **single-step format**. 

gross profit is the amount of revenue available after subtracting the costs of delivering goods or services.毛利

**iii)** Another important subtotal which may be shown on the income statement is **operating profit** (or, synonymously, operating income).

 Operating profit results from deducting operating expenses such as selling, general, administrative, and research and development expenses from gross profit. Operating profit reflects a company’s profits on its business activities *before deducting taxes*, and for non-financial companies, *before deducting interest expense*. 

Operating profit is sometimes referred to as EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), but not necessarily the same.

### 3) Revenue Recognition

Gains are similar to reve- nue, but they typically arise from secondary or peripheral activities rather than from a company’s primary business activities.

revenue should be recognized to “depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration **to which the entity expects to be entitled** in an exchange for those goods or services.” 

entitle 使享有权利



When revenue is recognized, a contract asset is presented on the balance sheet. It is only at the point when all performance obligations have been met except for payment that a receivable appears on the seller’s balance sheet. If consideration is received in advance of transferring good(s) or service(s), the seller presents a contract liability.

### 4）Expense Recognition

A general principle of expense recognition is the **matching principle**. 

**Period costs**, expenditures that less directly match revenues, are reflected in the period when a company makes the expenditure or incurs the liability to pay. Administrative expenses are an example of period costs. 

**specific identification method**,**FIFO method**,**weighted average cost method**,**LIFO method**

Practically, the reason some companies choose to use LIFO in the United States is to reduce taxes. When prices and inventory quantities are rising, LIFO will normally result in higher cost of goods sold and lower income and hence lower taxes. US tax regulations require that if LIFO is used on a company’s tax return, it must also be used on the company’s GAAP financial statements.

### 5) Issue in Expense Recognition: Doubtful Account, warranties

Doubtful account: record a estimate ratio of revenue recoginzed on sale, based on previous experience.

Warranties: 保修期， estimate the amount of future of expense resulted from warranties.

### 6)ISSUES IN EXPENSE RECOGNITION: DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

**Long-lived assets** are assets expected to provide economic benefits over a future period of time greater than one year. Examples are land (property), plant, equipment, and **intangible assets** 无形资产(assets lacking physical substance) such as trademarks.

**Depreciation** is the process of systematically allocating costs of long-lived assets over the period during which the assets are expected to provide economic benefits.

**amortisation** 摊销 is the term commonly applied to this process for intangible long-lived assets with a finite useful life

“Depreciation” is the term commonly applied to this process for physical long-lived assets such as plant and equipment (land is not depreciated), and **amortisation** is the term commonly applied to this process for intangible long-lived assets with a finite useful life.

Under the cost model, the depreciable amount of that asset (cost less residual value) is allocated on a systematic basis over the remaining useful life of the asset. Under the cost model, the asset is reported at its cost less any accumulated depreciation. Under the revaluation model, the asset is reported at its fair value. 

IFRS allows cost model and revaluation model

US GAAP allows cost model only.

The **straight-line method** allocates evenly the cost of long-lived assets less esti- mated residual value over the estimated useful life of an asset.
$$
\frac{Cost-Residual value}{EstimateUsefulLife}
$$
**accelerated methods** of depreciation accelerate (i.e., speed up) the timing of depreciation.

$a_n=a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}*m\%$

$b_n=C-a_n$

$a_0=0$

### 7)IMPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ANALYSTS: EXPENSE RECOGNITION

As with revenue recognition policies, a company’s choice of expense recognition can be characterized by its relative conservatism. A policy that results in recognition of expenses later rather than sooner is considered less conservative.

nformation about a company’s accounting policies and significant estimates are described in the notes to the financial statements and in the management discussion and analysis section of a company’s annual report.



### 8)NON-RECURRING ITEMS AND NON-OPERATING ITEMS: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENT ITEMS 非经常性项目和非经营性项目：停止经营和不寻常或不常见的项目

To assess a company’s future earnings, it is helpful to separate those prior years’ items of income and expense that are likely to continue in the future from those items that are less likely to continue



When a company disposes of or establishes a plan to dispose of one of its component operations and will have no further involvement in the operation, the income state- ment reports separately the effect of this disposal as a “discontinued” operation under both IFRS and US GAAP. 

Under US GAAP, material items that are unusual or infrequent, and that are both as of reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, are shown as part of a company’s continuing operations but are presented separately.

### 9) NON-RECURRING ITEMS: CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY

Changes in accounting policies are reported through retrospective application25 unless it is impractical to do so.

*Retrospective application* means that the financial statements for all fiscal years shown in a company’s financial report are presented as if the newly adopted accounting principle had been used throughout the entire period. 

Under the modified retrospective approach, companies were not required to revise previously reported financial statements.

In contrast to changes in accounting policies (such as whether to expense the cost of employee stock options), companies sometimes make ***changes in accounting estimates*** (such as the useful life of a depreciable asset). Changes in accounting estimates are handled prospectively, with the change affecting the financial statements for the period of change and future periods.

Another possible adjustment is a ***correction of an error for a prior period*** (e.g., in financial statements issued for an earlier year). This cannot be handled by simply adjusting the current period income statement.

### 10) Non operating Items

Non-operating items are typically reported separately from operating income because they are material and/or relevant to the understanding of the entity’s financial per- formance. 

Under US GAAP, operating activities generally involve producing and delivering goods and providing services and include all transactions and other events that are **not defined** as investing or financing activities. 不是投资公司，投资股票等金融产品赚的钱不算经营收益

The amount of inter- est expense is related to the amount of a company’s borrowings and is generally described in the notes to the financial statements. 

Specifically, under IFRS, interest and dividends received can be shown either as operating or as investing on the statement of cash flows, while under US GAAP interest and dividends received are shown as operating cash flows. Under IFRS, interest and dividends paid can be shown either as operating or as financing on the statement of cash flows, while under US GAAP, interest paid is shown as operating and dividends paid are shown as financing.)

In practice, companies often disclose the interest expense and income separately, along with a net amount.

### 11）EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND BASIC EPS

liquidation 清偿

**Ordinary shares** are those equity shares that are subordinate to all other types of equity. The ordinary shareholders are basically the owners of the company—the equity holders who are paid last in a liquidation of the company and who benefit the most when the company does well.

Under US GAAP, this ordinary equity is referred to as **common stock** or **common shares**

When a company has issued any financial instruments that are potentially con- vertible into common stock, it is said to have a **complex capital structure**. convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, employee stock options, and warrants.

The EPS that would result if all dilutive financial instruments were converted is called **diluted EPS**. In contrast, **basic EPS** is calculated using the reported earnings available to common shareholders of the parent company and the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

- Basic EPS

Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over a period.

The amount of income available to common shareholders is the amount of net income remaining after preferred dividends (if any) have been paid
$$
Basic EPS=\frac{NetIncome-PreferredDividends}{WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesOutstanding}
$$
The weighted average number of shares outstanding is a time weighting of common shares outstanding. For example, assume a company began the year with 2,000,000 common shares outstanding and repurchased 100,000 common shares on 1 July. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding would be the sum of 2,000,000 shares × 1/2 year + 1,900,000 shares × 1/2 year, or 1,950,000 shares. So the company would use 1,950,000 shares as the weighted average number of shares in calculating its basic EPS.

The weighted average number of shares outstanding is determined by **the length of time each quantity of shares was outstanding**.

### 12） If-converted method

The if-converted method is based on what EPS would have been if the convertible preferred securities had been converted at the beginning of the period.

- Preferred Stock oustanding

Diluted EPS using the if-converted method for convertible preferred stock is equal to net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding from the basic EPS calculation plus the additional shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the preferred.

- Convertible Debt Outstanding

the net income available to common shareholders would increase by the after-tax amount of interest expense on the debt converted.

### 13) Treasury Stock Method

The weighted average number of shares outstanding for diluted EPS is thus increased by the number of shares that would be issued upon exercise minus the number of shares that would have been purchased with the proceeds. This method is called the **treasury stock method** under US GAAP because companies typically hold repurchased shares as treasury stock. The same method is used under IFRS but is not named.

option exercise, company receives cash, and common shares are outstanding.

Under the treasury stock method, we assume that shares would be repurchased with the cash received upon exercise of the options.

### 14)OTHER ISSUES WITH DILUTED EPS AND CHANGES IN EPS

antidilutive: securities make EPS higher

antidilutive securities are not included in the calculation of diluted EPS. 

In general, an increase in EPS results from an increase in net income, a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, or a combination of both.

### 15) common size analysis of the income statement

gross margin 毛利率

Operating Margin 营业利润率

Net Profit Margin 净利润率

Common-size analysis of the income statement can be performed by stating each line item on the income statement as a percentage of revenue.

For most expenses, comparison to the amount of sales is appropriate. However, in the case of taxes, it is more meaningful to compare the amount of taxes with the amount of pretax income.

### 16） income statement ratios

- net profit margin=profit margin=return on sales=net income / revenue

Net profit margin measures the amount of income that a company was able to gen- erate for each dollar of revenue.

- gross profit margin = gross profit / revenue

The gross profit margin measures the amount of gross profit that a company gener- ated for each dollar of revenue.
