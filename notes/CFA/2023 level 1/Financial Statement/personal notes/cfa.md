Interest Rates
`r = real_risk_free_interest_rate + inflation_premium + default_risk_premium + liquidity_premium + maturity_premium`

Effective annual rate(EAR): the rate with less maturity compounding than annual rate may higher than the annual one.
that is because:
(1 + r/m) ^ (m) = 1 + r + ... > 1 + r
