- **factor** is the one who purchases the receivables.

7、flotation cost要include在initial cash outflow of the project中。（equity）

8、CAPM和SML线联系在一起，在线上方是undervalue，在线下方是overvalue。在线上是equal the market's performance.

14、pitfall陷阱、隐患。only incremental overhead costs related to a project should be included in the analysis.

- overhead cost经常性开支

16、如果interest coverage ratio <2，认为是warning sign.

23、

- sells primarilly on credit
- Enbird is a regional airline that leases its aircraft and service facilities. 资产都是租的
- advance payments for subscriptions.
- sell on credit和另外两个asset-light, pay-in-advance模式比起来，需要更多的 capital

26、estimated return < CAPM计算的required return.证明是高估overvalue，在SML线下方。

29、cyclical firms tend to have high systematic risk, which means high beta.

- utility stock指的是公共事业股票，水电气，non-cyclical
- homebuilder stock和周期有关，是cyclical

31、matrix pricing

- 直接用平均值算某年的yield
- 然后根据T插值

32、novate: replace a new contract. novation: a central clearing house taking the opposite positions to both counterparties.

- 46、"top-heavy" refers to a capital structure that includes a high percentage of **secured bank debt**. 这种情况，很难再从银行借钱，increases the likelihood of default if the firm encounters financial distress.
- 49、注意，exercise value = intrinsic value = (e.g. call)max(S-X/(1+r_f)^t,0)
  - 但是，exercise price = X
  - option premium = exercise value + time value
  - time value = speculative value
- 50、interpolated spread = I-Spread
- 51、total return 包括dividend
- 54、duration-based estimates of bond value changes assume the yield curve shifts in a parallel manner. If instead short-term interest rates are more volatile than long-term interest rates, it is possible for a bond with lower duration to have more price volatility than a bond with higher duration.
- 关于yield curve、平行移动。
  - yield curve就是收益率-时间曲线，横坐标是时间，纵坐标是收益率。一般呈现的是向上的曲线，也就是short-term yield is lower than long-term yield. 
    - [![img](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Yield_curve_20180513.png/250px-Yield_curve_20180513.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yield_curve_20180513.png)
  - 另外，由于central bank controls short-term interest rate to influence AD. 所以短期收益率一般波动率大，long-term yield 波动率较小。则称为term structure of yield volatility.
  - yield curve的平行移动，一般做不到，因为短期利率移动的幅度会更大。
- yield curve的移动，直接导致某个债券的price-yield曲线的横坐标发生变化，会导致price volatility.
  - 债券price volatility和两个因素有关：1）price-yield曲线的形态，也就是duration and convexity; 2）横坐标yield的变动幅度，也就是yield volatility
  - 所以，a greater duration and covexity don't guarantee a greater price volatility. 因为有可能duration大，但是是long-term bond，所以yield volatility 小。也就是yield curve non-parallel shift.
  - 从$p/\Delta p$的近似式子就可以看出，price volatility 由上面说的两部分组成

$$
\%\Delta P^{Full}=-ModDur\Delta r+\frac{1}{2}Convexity(\Delta r^2)
$$

59、Valuations based on appraisals tend to smooth returns compared to using market-based valuations. As a result, returns based on an appraisal index are likely to have a lower standard deviation than returns based on a repeat sales index or a REIT index.

- 主观appraisals index波动最小。

69、**Structural subordination** Arises in a holding company structure when the debt of operating subsidiaries is serviced by the cash flow and assets of the subsidiaries before funds can be passed to the holding company to service debt at the parent level.

- Restricted subsidiaries are those whose cash flows and assets are designated to service the debt of their holding company. Classifying a subsidiary as restricted alleviates structural subordination by making holding company debt rank pari passu with the subsidiary's debt.
- 把子公司列为restricted. 子公司赚了钱，先上交还母公司的债。

81、growth cycle的时候，竞争还不激烈。

85、accretive: characterized by gradually growth.

- 如果发生兼并收购，改变了公司的盈利模式的话。采用forward P/E ratio，用未来的现金流估计比较合适。

88、计算具体的bond return yield的时候。coupon按照reinvestment rate计算收益，然后

- PV=FV/(1+r)^N
- 注意r最后要年化。如果periodicity=2，yield=r*2.

46、 central bank的exchange rate targeting会受到available resources limitation, 也就是foreign reserves的限制。

- 另外两个目标inflation and interest rate targeting 不是收到resources 限制。

50、from a point of view of financial analyst，是分析师的角度，分析师想要最准确，比如存货反应最新价值，COGS反应最新的价值。这点和公司管理层角度不一样，管理层如果希望盈利高，资产多，那么会希望存货价值越高越好，COGS越低越好。whose point of view are we looking from需要特别注意。

56、the presentation format of balance shee t data that standardizes the first-year values to 1.0 and presents subsequent years' amounts relative to 1.0 is a horizontal common-size balance sheet. 时间对比，horizontal.

vertical common-size是和Total asset做出发。

57、如果增加asset estimated useful life，会导致carrying value上升，所以DTL增加。

- 如果DTA DTL同时上升，有可能是tax rate变动
- 未来预期profitability 下降，会增加DTA allowance.

59、From an initial equilibrium, an increase in real money balances will leave households and businesses with more money than they wish to hold, so they will purchase interest-bearing securities, driving their prices up and yields down until a new equilibrium short-term rate is established. 发钱，有钱了，买interest-bearing securities，然后这些securities价格上升，导致interest 下降达到新的equilibrium.

70、列联表检验，是test of **independence**.

- independent variables are uncorrelated, but uncorrelated(no linear relationship) variables are not necessarily independent.

79、premium payments on life insurance of key employees is an expense on the financial statments, but is not deducted on tax returns. 人寿保险费用，永久性差异。

- - Which of the following factors is *most likely* to lead to economies of scale?

  1. Supply constraints
  2. Duplication of product lines
  3. **Specialization by workers**
     - Specialization by workers can increase their proficiency, leading to lower average costs when the firm is large enough to allow specialization.

As the firm grows in size, economies of scale and a lower ATC can result from the following factors: 规模经济的原因

- Increasing **returns to scale**（<u>When a production process leads to increases in output that are proportionately smaller than the increase in inputs.</u>）, which is when a production process allows for increases in output that are proportionately larger than the increase in inputs.
- Having a division of labor and management in a large firm with numerous workers, which allows each worker to **specialize** in one task rather than perform many duties, as in the case of a small business (as such, workers in a large firm become more proficient at their jobs).专人专用

- 50、The relationship between domestic savings, private investment, the fiscal balance, and the trade balance is given by *S* = *I* + (*G* – *T*) + (*X* – *M*), where

  *S* = Domestic savings

  *I* = Private investment(gross private domestic investment, which includes **business investment in capital goods** (e.g., fixed capital such as plant and equipment) and **changes in inventory** (inventory investment))

  *G* = Government spending(government spending on final goods and services for both **current consumption** and **investment in capital goods** = $G_C + G_I$)

  *T* = Total government tax revenues

  *X* = Exports

  *M* = Imports

  *G* – *T* = The government deficit

  *X* – *M* = The trade deficit

  The trade deficit will be (*X* – *M*) = (*S* – *I*) – (*G* – *T*).

  For the hypothetical economy, the following is true:

  - Domestic savings (*S*) is given as 638.
  - Total private investment (*I*) = Business gross fixed investment + Change in inventories = 538 + (–16) = 522.
  - Total government spending (*G*) = Government spending + Government fixed investment = 666 + 118 = 784.
  - Tax on households = Personal income – Personal disposable income.
  - Net tax paid by households = Tax on households – Transfer payments to consumers.
  - Total government revenues (*T*) = Net tax paid by households + Other tax revenues = (2,456 – 1,930) – 348 + 440 = 618. 
    - 可见，government revenue分 net tax + other tax. net tax是 tax 减去转移支付。tax是personal income - personal disposable income/
  - Net government spending (*G* – *T*) = Total government spending – Total government revenues = 784 – 618 = –166.
  - Trade deficit = (*X* – *M*) = (*S* – *I*) – (*G* – *T*) = (Total domestic saving – Total private investment) – Net government spending = (638 – 522) – 166 **= –**50.

- 54、In general, the inflation rate is pro-cyclical (that is, it goes up and down with the cycle), but with a lag of a year or more. CPI是滞后指标

- 58、as an economy slows and unemployment rises, **government spending [expenditure] on social insurance and unemployment benefits** will also rise and add to aggregate demand. This is known as an automatic stabilizer." 自动稳定器，主要看的是自动，不需要政府主动决策。比如失业救助，医疗救助金，自动增加的税收等。

- 73、for a mature company, because net income includes **non-cash expenses (depreciation and amortization),** operating cash flow typically exceeds net income. 成熟企业折旧比较多

- 76、2/10 net 30 is **a trade credit often offered by suppliers to buyers**. It represents an agreement that the buyer will receive a 2% discount on the net invoice amount if they pay within 10 days. Otherwise, the full invoice amount is due within 30 days.

- 77、FFO = funds from operations, defined as EBITDA minus net interest expense minus current tax expense (plus or minus all applicable adjustments).
  - If interest income and expense are combined, the line item can be called “Interest Income – net” or “Interest Expense – net.”
  - FFO = EBITDA - net interest expense - current tax expense +/- ...

- 78、在存货确认cost中：Abnormal waste, storage of finished goods, and administrative overhead are expensed.
  - Transportation-in, Tax-related duties关税, Trade discounts计入cost
- 81、不考虑税收的话，capitalized或者expensed interest不会影响实际的cash flow。
- 85、pledged，是担保的意思

- 57、For a coupon bond with a positive yield, compounding more frequently within the year results in a yield-to-maturity that is less positive.

  - For a **given** pair of cash flows, the stated annual rate and the periodicity are inversely related. Increasing the frequency of compounding lowers the annual rate. 

  - 这句话，意思是原来的ytm是确定的, periodicity和对应的ytm(r)的关系

  - $$
    1+YTM = (1+\frac{r}{n})^n\\
    r=n(y^{1/n}-1)
    $$

Typically, the parent doesn’t generate much of its own earnings or cash flow but instead receives dividends from its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries’ dividends are generally paid out of earnings after they satisfy all their other obligations, such as debt payments. … The parent’s reliance on cash flow from its subsidiaries means the parent’s debt is structurally subordinated to the subsidiaries’ debt and thus will usually have a lower recovery rating in default. 母公司依赖于子公司的股利。子公司支付股利前，已经还了债，所以，母公司的债比子公司的债等级低，parent一般更低的rating.
