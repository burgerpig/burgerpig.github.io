- 盈亏平衡点break even就是ATC=AR。不分短期长期。
- minimum efficient scale是相对于LRAC的横坐标而言。所以operating beyond minimum efficient scale指的是横坐标比MES大。规模不经济。
- the company’s fixed costs have increased faster than output, and the economic result is diseconomies of scale.

# M3

- 在国外生产，然后在A国卖，不算入A国GDP
- At the full employment, or natural, level of output, the economy is operating at an efficient and unconstrained level of production. Companies have enough spare capacity to avoid bottlenecks, and there is a modest, stable pool of unemployed workers (job seekers equal job vacancies) looking for and transitioning into new jobs.
- An **increase in energy prices** will **shift** the short-run aggregate supply curve (**SRAS**) to the **left**, reducing output and increasing prices.
-  Labor productivity can be directly measured as output/hour.
- In the standard Solow growth accounting equation, the coefficient on each factor’s growth rate is its share of income.
  - Potential output growth = 1.5 + 0.72 × Growth of labor + 0.28 × Growth of capital
    - 0.72意思是the share of income earned by labor.
- Diminishing marginal productivity of capital means that as a country accumulates more capital per worker, the incremental boost to output declines. Thus, all else equal, **economies grow more slowly as they become more capital intensive**. Given the relative scarcity and hence high marginal productivity of capital in developing countries, these economies tend to grow more rapidly than developed countries. This dynamic leads to convergence in income levels over time.
  - 发展中国家和发达国家不断靠近，因为diminishing marginal productivity of capital.

- As domestic income rises, some of the additional demand that is induced will be for imported goods. Thus, net exports will decline. 
  - domestic income提升时，大家有钱了，进口商品多，所以
    - net export X-M 减少
    - 政府的赤字减小，government deficit G-T decrease
    - Saving and investment increase
- 本币贬值，利于出口，ADshift right
- GDP收入法，不能说citizen的收入，要说household的收入
  - GDP is the aggregate income earned by all households, all companies, and the government within the economy in a given period of time (income definition).

# Cycle

Real Business Cycle models conclude that expansions and contractions of the economy are responses to external shocks, such as supply shocks arising from advances in technology or changes in the relative prices of inputs (e.g., energy prices). An increase in energy prices shifts short-run aggregate supply to the left, resulting in higher prices and lower GDP.

- Austrian主张躺平。认为不可以过度投资。政府不应该过度干预，
  - markets are in general flexible and prices will easily adjust to changing situations. This makes the aggregate supply curve very steep, even in the short run
-  inventory–sales and unit labor costs are lagging indicators

- PPI category weights can vary more widely than analogous CPI terms.
- Cost-push inflation refers to the situation in which rising costs, usually wages, compel businesses to raise prices.
- The NARU and NAIRU are the unemployment rates at which the inflation rate will not rise because of a shortage of labor
-  The **Fisher index** is the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes, and it will therefore display less of a substitution bias than the other two
