- The **EV/EBITDA** (enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) approach is most useful when comparing companies **with significant differences in capital structure**. EBITDA is computed prior to payment to any of the company’s financial stakeholders and is not affected by the amount of debt leverage.
- **defensive industry:** stable earning, non-cyclical.注意是稳定盈利，不断增长的盈利也不算。
- The process of constructing peer group consists of initially examining **commercial** classification systems and then **refining** it to the companies operating in the chosen industry.
- Companies with large amounts of undervalued assets (which can be sold to reduce debt) that generate high levels of cash flow (which are used to make interest and principal payments on the debt) are likely candidates for MBO transactions.
- Investing in DRs could provide arbitrage opportunities and entail currency risk.

Participating preference shares **do not** entitle the shareholders to participate in corporate decisions through voting rights. But they do entitle them to 

- (1) an additional dividend if the company’s profits exceed a prespecified level and

-  (2) additional distribution of the company’s assets upon **liquidation**, above the par.

> A trader has purchased 200 shares of a non-dividend-paying firm on margin at a price of $50 per share. The leverage ratio is 2.5. Six months later, the trader sells these shares at $60 per share. Ignoring the interest paid on the borrowed amount and the transaction costs, what was the return to the trader during the six-month period?

这题，直接算(60-50)/50=0.2，带杠杆，0.2*2.5 = 0.5收益率

- The stock was bought on 75 percent margin. 意思是75%是本金

- WACC里的都是marginal term

- leverage越高，breakeven的Q越大

- The more unit sales are from the operating breakeven point for high-levrage companies, the greater the magnifiying effect of leverage. 买的越多，赚的越多，杠杆越有用。

  - Enterprise value, sometimes known as the **cost of a takeover**, is the cost of the purchase of the company, which would include the assumption of the company’s debts at market value.
- Asset base valuation 用的是market value, A - L
