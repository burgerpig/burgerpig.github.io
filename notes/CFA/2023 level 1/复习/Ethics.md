# M1 Introduction

- 错题：1、8、9、11
- 关注：3、4、5、6
- 1、standard of conduct 是**minimal acceptable**
  - Codes of ethics serve as a **general** guide for how community members should act

- 8、only using compliance approach 是oversimplfying decision making
  - A compliance approach can oversimplify decision making and <u>may not encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture</u>. A strong compliance culture may be a good start in developing an ethical culture but can become another situational influence that may result in employees failing to consider other important factors.
- 9、The investment management profession and investment firms must be interdependent to maintain trust. 投行和投资管理之间要独立。
- 11、Using an ethical decision-making framework consistently will help you develop sound judgment and decision-making skills and **avoid making decisions that have unanticipated ethical consequences**. The decision-making process is often iterative, and the decision maker may move between phases of the framework. A decision maker should consider more than confirmable facts and relationships; for example, the decision maker should consider situational influences and personal biases.
  - ethical decision-making，就是identify、consider、decide and act、reflect的iterative过程
  - exclusively：仅仅
  - sequence：系列，顺序
- 3、不道德的行为，decrease revenue, increase cost
- 4、High ethical standards distinguish **professions** from the **craft guilds** or **trade bodies**. Unlike trade bodies, professional bodies also typically have a mission to serve society and enforce professional conduct rules for practitioners.
- 5、fiduciary信托的，受托的。fiduciary duty受托责任。professionals
  - Fiduciary duty is an obligation to deliver a high standard of care when acting for the benefit of another party. Professionals must act in the best interest of the client, exercising a reasonable level of care, skill, and diligence. Other entities—including employers, regulators, trade associations, and not-for-profit bodies—may also support an industry but are not the same as professional bodies. Unlike professions, these other entities generally do not exist to set and maintain professional standards.
- 6、prestige威望，faulty 有缺陷的
- **Ethical conduct goes beyond legal standards**

# M2 Ethics

- 错题：1、4、6、7、9、12

- 关注：3、11

- 1、The *Standards of Practice Handbook* provides guidance to which CFA Institute members and candidates are required to adhere. 这个Handbook就是道德的具体的手册。

- 4、Given the constant development of new and exotic financial instru- ments and strategies, the standard regarding communicating with clients now includes an implicit requirement to discuss the risks and limitations of recommendations being made to clients. 

  - 现在的版本要求在和客户推荐产品时，讲清楚risk and limitations
  - 除了约束CFA，还包括CIPM等

- 6、

  - 注意形容词和要求之间要匹配
    - disclose promptly
    - managing portfolio的时候，consistent with the stated objectives of the portfolio
    - fair，accurate and complete是针对业绩披露（performance presentation 而言）
    - 保密preservation of confidentiality，除非required by law or permission by clients，都要保密
    - reasonable and adequate basis是针对diligence and reasonable basis有理有据而言。
    - requires members and candidates to promptly disclose any changes that might materially affect investment processes.
  - A is incorrect because under Standard III.C.2 Suitability, when members and candidates are responsible for managing a portfolio according to a specific mandate, they must take only investment actions that are consistent with the stated objectives of the portfolio. 
    - The “fair, accurate, and complete” criterion relates to the Standard III D Performance Presentation.
  - C is incorrect because under Standard III.E.1, 2, 3 Preservation of Confidentiality, members and candidates must keep information about current clients confidential unless the information concerns illegal activities on the part of the client, disclosure is required by law, or the client permits disclosure. 
    - No decisions on confidentiality are required, with the “reasonable and adequate basis” criterion related to Standard V.A.2 Diligence and Reasonable Basis.

- 7、这题也太狗了。注意Ethics不能混在一起表述，也不能缺斤少两

  - 比如下面两种说法就是错的❌：
    - ❌Responsibilities to clients and employers，把client和employer混为一谈
    - ❌Ethics involved in investment analysis and recommendations，少了“Actions”

- 9、not knowly make a misrepresentation relating to a recommendation是输入Misrepresentation(I(C))

  - consider investments in the context of the client’s total portfolio，这个属于III(C)Suitability

- 11、注意匹配不同的Ethics

  - accept any gifts that might compromise their independence and objectivity这个属于I(B) Independence and Objectivity

- 3、Promote the integrity and viability of the global markets for the ultimate benefit of society

- 12、和11题差不多，要匹配不同的Ethic 要求

- The V.B.4 Communications with Clients and Prospective Clients section of the Investment Analysis, Recommendations, and Actions standard states that members and candidates must distinguish between fact and opinion in the presentation of investment analysis and recommendations.

  - find an investment **suitable** for their client before making a recommendation.

   is discussed in the **III.C.1b Suitability** section of the Duties to Clients standard.

  - make **reasonable efforts** to ensure that **performance presentation** is fair, accurate, and complete. is discussed in the **III.D Performance Presentation** section of the Duties to Clients standard.

- 错题：12、13、15、19、21、28、29、35、38
- 关注：3、8、9、10、16、20、24、25、26、27、30、32、33、34、36、39
- 12、可以接受顾客的其他报酬IV(B) Other compensation，但是需要获得employer同意
- 13、It does not matter that the brokerage firm also provides research information that is **not useful** for the account generating the commission because Farnsworth is **not paying extra money** of the client’s for that information.
  - 没有用到客户的资金，把送来的报告用于其他用途，不影响III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care.
- 15、也就是mutual fund投资的是Treasury bond，不可以对mutual fund承诺保本。

- 19、**Written consent from the employer** is necessary to permit **independent** practice that could result in **compensation** or other **benefits in competition**  with a member’s or candidate’s employer. 
  - independent practice指的是兼职，需要获得雇主的同意（consent）.所以，**并不禁止**independent practice.
-  the  Standards **allow** members and candidates to make arrangements or preparations  to go into competitive business as long as those arrangements **do not interfere**  with their duty to their current employer. 只要不影响对雇主的义务(do not breach his duty of loyalty)，可以在离职前准备。（比如own-time）
- 21、在这题的案例，虽然事实上基金经理取得了26%的收益，但是一大部分都是客户没有按照基金经理的建议去投资。这种情况，如果宣称自己的历史是26%的收益而没有说明，那么就是misrepresentation.(fail to present a fair, accurate, and complete presentation of performance)

- 28、CFA考试没有披露具体的成绩，所以candidates不能对外宣称自己每个科目都取得了高分（highest possible scores）.另外，如果宣称自己连续一次性通过了考试，是允许的。
- 29、**Soft dollar accounts** should  be used **only** to purchase **research services** that **directly** assist the investment  manager in the investment decision-making process, not to assist the management of the firm or to further education. 不能用soft dollar来学习CFA.
- 35、**sat for** the CFA exam. 指的是参加了CFA考试。参加了考试不能代表通过。
- 38、如果过往业绩是和其他人共同完成，根据III(D) Performance Presentation，需要披露自己的一部分。should included the return of the portion he **directly** managed.
- 3、有利益冲突还是可以出具报告，但是要disclose披露。（这道题的A，违反conduct和是否出具意见express opinion无关，不管是不是出具意见，都要disclose interest conflicts。另外，restricted list限制清单中，需要停止出具意见(I(B))）
- 8、可以说pass Level II，但不可以说自己是"CFA Level II".
- 9、V(B) Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients. 不可以混淆opinion和facts. 比如这题的dividend will increase 1.5就是facts 的表述。
  - 另外，It may be **acceptable** to base a recommendation, in part,  on an expectation of future events, **even though they may be uncertain**.就算预测不准确，也是可以recommend.
- 10、If a new investment recommendation is made, 需要minimizing the time between the **decision** and the **dissemination** of a  recommendation. 一旦决定投资建议，要尽快公布。（III(B)Fair Dealing）
  - 当recommendation被disseminated前，公司内部应该越少人知道越好。
- 16、不可以从客户交易中，从broker获益（personal lower transaction fees）
  - IV(C) responsibilites of Supervisors，supervisor 需要adequatedly enforce requirements.
- 20、自己brother-in-law是recommend公司的brother-in-law，**不算**关联方conflict of interest.
- 24、VI(C) Referral Fees的两个原因
  - allow clients and employers to evaluate the full cost of the services.
  - help the client evaluate any possible partiality（偏袒） shown in the recommendation of services
- 25、自己公司出具了strong buy意见，但是自己出于要交学费的原因，需要卖personal stocks。属于VI(B) Priority of Transactions的要求。不会限制和公司推荐相反的私人交易，**前提是does not disadvantage current clients**。
- 26、对于IV(A) Loyalty（对雇主）
  - 不可以solicitation of the employer's clients prior to cessation of employment. 不管有没有披露，都不可以solicit
  - 背景，开了一家公司需要招聘，并且需要初期的AUM，只要拉来投资入职，就可以奖励1万美元。这种incentive不违规。
- 27、这题大概意思是，Carter用的一家broker，提供了一种新的交易方式。新的交易方式和老的交易方式的soft dollar prohibited账户费用相当（comparable）. broker为了吸引顾客，用新交易方式的佣金用作老交易方式。
  - 允许在soft dollar prohibit账户下进行新的交易。
- 30、邀请我去演讲，包机票，包住宿，又请我去打高尔夫。I(B) Indenpendence and objectivity
  - conference-related可以接受，不可以打高尔夫

- 32、对于操纵市场volume，属于违反II(B) Market Manipulation.
  - 另外，press release 正常的消息不属于违反规定，比如 reaffirming prior announced earnings guidance.
- 33、violated III(D) Performance presentations when deviated from the firm’s stated policies solely to capture the gain from  the holding being acquired. 也就是本来按照一个月披露业绩，发现期间有一笔大交易提高了业绩，于是特意调整日期把这天算进去。这样算作违规。
- 34、没有禁止在家工作，用私人电脑工作。但是V(C) Record Retention禁止离职后，without permission 地保留资料。
- 36、利用重大非公开信息，投资相关地基金，也不可以。比如从某个retailer CFO口中听到消息，然后没有直接买这家股票，但是买了retailer related ETF，也是违反II(A) Material nonpublic information.

# M4 GIPS

- 错题：1、2、8、9
- 关注：4
- 1、GIPS，不能只选择top-performance，
  - 包含terminated portfolio is consistent with GIPS
  - 包括covering all periods is consitent with GIPS
- 2、**Asset owners** can claim compliance if they manage actual assets for  which they are making a claim of compliance.
  - software不可以声称符合GIPS
  - firms要么全部符合GIPS，要么不符合。不可以limit their compliance claims to the provisions they have chosen to follow.
- 8、Firms are **not required** to be verified in order to claim compliance  with the GIPS standards, although **verification** is recommended and viewed as  best practice. verification不是强制要求。
- 9、Compliance with the GIPS standards is **not typically required by  regulators**, nor are the GIPS standards intended to cover all regulatory requirements.
  - GIPS可以带来的好处：
    - Comparability of results across managers that claim compliance
    - Increased confidence by investors and beneficiaries
- 4、Verification是针对整个公司进行。
