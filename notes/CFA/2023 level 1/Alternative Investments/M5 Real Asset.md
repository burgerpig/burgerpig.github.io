## R3 Natural Resources

**Explain** investment characteristics of natural resources

#### Natural resources

- **Commodities**: traditionally physical products that can be **standardized** on quality, location, and delivery for the purpose of investing.
  - 质量、位置、交付标准标准化。标准化产品才是大宗商品。
- **Timberland and farmland**: land owned or leased for the returns it generates from crops and timber.

#### Characteristics of commodities

- Investment returns are based on **changes in price** rather than income stream such as interest, dividends or rent.
  - 没有income，只有价格变化带来的回报
- Holding physical commodities incurs transportation and storage costs. 涉及到运输和存储成本
  - Trading in physical commodities is primarily <u>limited</u> to a smaller group of entities in the physical supply chain.
    - 大宗商品交易比较少，一般是供应链上下游企业。
  - Most commodity investors do not trade actual physical commodities but, rather, trade **commodity derivatives**.

#### Sectors of commodites

- The relative importance, amount, and price of individual commodities evolve with society's preferences and needs. 不同板块的大宗商品价格走势受到社会发展阶段、需求影响

| Sector          | Sample Commodities                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Energy          | Oil, natural gas, electricity, coal       |
| Base metal      | Copper, aluminum, zinc, lead, tin, nickel |
| Precious metals | Gold, silver, platinum                    |
| Agriculture     | Grains, livestock, coffee                 |
| Digital         | Crytocurrency                             |
| Other           | Carbon credits, freight, forest products  |

#### Commodity Index

- To be transparent, investable, and replicable, commodity indexes typically set their prices based on futures contracts rather than underlying commodities.
  - 为了保证透明、可投资、可复制，一般用期货计算大宗商品指数，而不是现货价格。（所以存在偏差）
- Different commodity indexes are composed of different commodities and index weights
- Overall, low correlation with other asset classes.
  - Effective for portfolio diversification

#### Commodity futures pricing

- **Futures price $\approx$ Spot price(1+r) + storage costs - convenience yield**
  - 复习derivatives无套利定价：加成本、减收益
  - 上面的storage costs和convenience yield是终值，不用乘以利率
  - convenence yield便利收益：比如持有石油，突然停电了，可以用来发电。

|          | Real Assets实物资产                     | Financial Assets                        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Benefits | Convenience                             | Dividends + Coupons                     |
| Costs    | Interest + storage（资金成本+储存成本） | Interest + Custody（资金成本+托管成本） |

- Commodity futures price often **do not adhere to a strict cost-of-carry relationship**.
  - 不是严格按照无套利定价(复习derivatives cost of carry)，因为大宗商品和成本和收益不固定，和金融资产不一样。

- Futures prices may be differenct from spot prices
  - **Contango**升水: futures prices are higher than the spot price, the commodity forward curve is upward sloping（期货价格-时间曲线，时间越长，期货价格越高，因为加的costs越多）
    - Occurs when there is **little or no convenience yield**
  - **Backwardation**贴水: futures prices are lower than the spot price, the commodity forward curve is downward sloping（同理，期货价格-时间曲线，向下倾斜曲线，时间越长，期货价格越低，因为减去的yield越多）
    - Occurs when the **convenience yield is high**

#### Forms of commodity Investments 大宗商品投资形式

- Direct investment
- Derivatives
- Exchange-traded products(ETPs, either funds or notes)
  - 黄金ETF等
- Commodity Trading Advisors(CTAs)
  - 指的是对冲基金中的策略
- Funds specializing in specific commodity sectors
  - 这里特指private funds

#### Benefits of commodity investment

- Real hedge against **inflation risk** 可以对冲通胀风险，重要！
  - inflation beta 为正，可以抗通胀。比如TIPS债券

- Effective for **portfolio diversification** because of low correlation with other investment returns

#### Risk of commodity investment

- Commodity spot prices are a function of **supply and demand**
- Demand levels are influenced by global manufacturing dynamics and economic growth
- Producers cannot alter commodity supply quickly because extended lead times are needed to affect production levels
- 大宗商品没法根据需求曲线变动快速调整supply，生产周期比较长。会导致短期供需不匹配，导致价格会大幅波动。

#### Characteristics of timberland and farmland

- Value comes not just from the harvest but also from the offset to human activity.
  - offset to human activity指的是环保，吸收二氧化碳
- Timberland林地
  - Typically trading in **larger units** of land.
  - **Flexibility**: harvesting more trees when timber prices are up and delaying harvests when prices are down. 储存成本较低，可以灵活决定什么时候砍伐树木。这种特性可以一定程度对抗经济周期。
  - **Return driver:** biological growth; changes in spot prices and futures prices of cut wood; changes in the price of the underlying land.
    - Return driver意思是回报和哪些因素有关。树木生长速度和树木的价格决定了timberland的income，underlying land决定了timberland 的capital gain.

- Farmland农地
  - Typically trading in **much smaller sizes**
  - Provide a **hedge against inflation**
    - 农作物和通胀关系较大
  - **Little flexibility**: farm products must be harvested when ripe.
    - harvest上不具备灵活度
  - **Return driver**: harvest quantities; commodity price(e.g., the price of corn); and land price changes.

#### Risk of farmland investment

- Low liquidity商业化规模较小，交易量少
- High risk of negative cash flow because **fixed costs are relatively high**(the land must be cared for and crops need fertilizer, seed, and so on)
  - 固定成本太高
- Revenue is highly variable based on the **weather**
  - 气候大幅影响收成
- World trade and growing foreign agricultural **competition** result in declines of crop prices.

- 大宗商品和林地的区别：林地可以产生有income
- 林地和farmland的区别：林地在harvest上更加有flexibility
