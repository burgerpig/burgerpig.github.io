##### Fund investing

- **Indirect method**: Investor contributes capital to a fund, and the fund identifies, selects, and makes investments on the investor's behalf. 就是投给另类投资基金经理
  - Investment decisions are limited to either investing in the fund or not.
  - Fund investors are typically **unable to affect** the fund's underlying investments.

##### Co-investing

- The investor invests in assets indirectly through the fund but also **possesses rights**(known as co-investment rights) to invest directly in the same assets.
  - fund manager决定投哪些项目后，investor再自己跟投。

##### Direct investing

- An investor makes a direct investment in an asset without the use of an intermediary
  - **Great flexibility and control** when it comes to choosing their investments, selecting their preferred methods of financing, and planning their approach.
  - Typically reserved for larger and more sophisticated investors. 投资门槛高，金额高，一般不要大机构，并且通常自己有分析团队等。
