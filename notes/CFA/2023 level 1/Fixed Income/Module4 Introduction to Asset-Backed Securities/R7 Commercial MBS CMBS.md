三个知识点： non-recourse loan, ballon risk->extension risk; call protection

#### Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

- CMBS are backed by a pool of commericial mortgage loans on income producing property
  - Commericial mortgage loans are typically **non-recourse loans**, and the lender will face credit risk. 没有追索权，所以有更高的信用风险。\*\*
  - Measures of credit quality:
    - **Loan-to-value ratio**, the lower the better(loan / value)
    - **Debt service coverage(DSC) ratio**: net operating income (NOI) / debt service, the higher the better.
      - debt service包括贷款的利息和本金部分
      - NOI 就是commercial地产产生的operating income，一般是租金收入
- CMBS investors have **considerable** **call protection**, which differs from RMBS and results in CMBS trading more like corporate bond.
  - call protection: 意思是保护investor受到提前还款风险。
    - 复习：RMBS一般可以认为是callable bond（提前还款权利）
    - CMBS，限制了提前还款
  - call protection条款：
    - Prepayment lockout 提前还款锁定期
    - Defeasance 废止条款。提前还款买国债，通过coupon逐渐提前还款。
    - Prepayment penalty points 罚息
    - Yield maintenance charges 报酬率的维持
  - CMBS背后的back asset是为了买商业地产的贷款。一般不允许提前还款。
  
- CMBS investors may face "**ballon risk**" because many commercial mortgages are balloon loans.因为不让提前还款，所以会由更高的credit risk
  - The borrower may not able tomake the ballon payment due to failure to refinance or sell the property to generate sufficient funds
  - Those tranches with a higher priority will have a higher credit rating because loans defaults will first affect the lower tranches
  - The lender will be forced to extend the term of the loan. So, the balloon risk is also referred to as **extension risk** for CMBS.
    - 债务重组，ballon risk导致extension risk。这里和之前的prepayment risk下的extension risk不一样，这里的extension risk是由credit risk导致的。
