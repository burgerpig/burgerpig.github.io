- "During the Chinese New Year, a popular activity among my friends and family is **grabbing virtual red envelopes** in WeChat groups. It's quite an exciting and fun-filled tradition. WeChat, which is a widely used messaging app in China, allows users to send digital red envelopes containing money. During the festival, people send these envelopes in group chats, and everyone eagerly tries to be the fastest to click and claim the money. It's not just about the money, which is usually a small amount, but more about the thrill of the game and the joy of participating in this communal activity. This tradition brings an interactive and modern twist to the age-old practice of giving red envelopes during the New Year, symbolizing good luck and prosperity."

#### Accommodation

- It’s not the size of the house that matters to us, but the joy and comfort we experience together in our home. 
- There's a large supermarket within walking distance that caters to our daily needs, like vegetables and meats. 
- The availability of such facilities around our home **adds a lot of value** to our everyday life."

- "My wife was out on the balcony hanging up the laundry, carefully placing each piece of clothing onto the clothes rack. This is a common household chore in many cultures, where the natural air and sunlight are used to dry and freshen clothes. In our family, we often do this task together, as it's not only practical but also a good opportunity for a small chat and to enjoy the outdoor air. **It's quite interesting to note how such mundane tasks can be integral to daily life and even offer moments of bonding and simplicity."**

- It's become a **tradition** for us to visit hot springs every winter
- it **reinforces** our **longing** to have a bathtub at home
- In my opinion, it doesn't quite **meet** the **standards** I'm hoping for, especially when it **comes to** elementary education.
- **While** I appreciate the facilities in my current community, **I must say** I have reservations about the quality of the local school.

- The quality of education is a top priority for me, and I believe that a better school environment can significantly impact a child's academic and personal development.
